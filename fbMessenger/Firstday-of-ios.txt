I just started to get my hands on ios I am working on this facebook messenger app 
A lot of changes in Swift 3 the syntax has changed and its good until I find its alternate see this...

let rect = CGRectMake(0, 0, 100, 100)
let point = CGPointMake(0, 0)
let size = CGSizeMake(100, 100)

these are the old ones

let rect = CGRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: 100, height: 100)
let size = CGSize(width: 100, height: 100)
let point = CGPoint(x: 0, y: 0)

the new ones 

also the syntax for the setting a color is modified
instead of redColor() its red
